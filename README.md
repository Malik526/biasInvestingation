# Bias Investigation Project

This project investigates how artificial data generation from small datasets to large datasets can introduce bias. The code generates synthetic data from the Iris dataset and measures bias through mutual information scores.

## Project Structure
- Contains code for generating and analyzing synthetic data
- `results/`: Stores generated results and plots

## Usage
Run the `plot_mi_scores.py` script to generate mutual information plots across different sample sizes.
